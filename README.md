# LinkedIn Automation

## Current Status
The bot is partially working with the following features implemented:
- ✅ Login functionality
- ✅ Job search with filters
- ✅ PDF resume parsing
- ✅ GPT integration for form responses
- ✅ Basic error handling and logging

## Current Issues
1. Easy Apply button detection needs improvement
   - The bot can find the button but has trouble clicking it
   - Current selectors need to be updated for dynamic job titles in aria-labels

2. Form handling needs testing
   - Multi-step application forms haven't been fully tested
   - GPT responses for form fields need validation

## Next Steps
1. Fix Easy Apply button interaction
   - Test different click methods (direct click, JavaScript click)
   - Add more robust error handling for button clicks
   - Implement better button state verification

2. Test and improve form handling
   - Add support for different form field types
   - Test multi-page applications
   - Add validation for GPT responses

3. Add safety features
   - Implement better rate limiting
   - Add more random delays
   - Improve error recovery

## Configuration
Current settings in `config.json`:
- Daily application limit: 15
- Session length: 4 hours
- Random delays between applications: 45-90 seconds

## Notes
- The bot currently targets Edge browser
- Easy Apply button HTML structure example:
```html
<button aria-label="Easy Apply to [Job Title] at [Company]" 
        class="jobs-apply-button artdeco-button artdeco-button--3 artdeco-button--primary" 
        data-job-id="[id]" 
        data-live-test-job-apply-button="">
    <span class="artdeco-button__text">Easy Apply</span>
</button>
```

## Last Working On
Button click handling in `linkedin_bot.py`:
- Issue with button click reliability
- Need to improve button detection for dynamic job titles
- Consider implementing additional click attempts with different methods
